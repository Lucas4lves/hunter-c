# Hunter C
 * Easing the task of creating new header files for your C project. It only supports GNU/Linux platform
## Initial prospects
 * It is a command line program written in bash, but I plan to make it a full fledged CLI tool;
 * You can already test it to create headers using "hunter create header {header-name}";
 * Its output is a /headers directory with the generated .h files, including ifndef guard clauses;
